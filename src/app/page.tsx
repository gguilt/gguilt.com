      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mt-5">Who are you, really?</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I&apos;m Gökay. I develop modern websites using Next.js (and sometimes with Svelte).
        Programming is my art, and despite the fact that I will use anything to solve the problem, 
        I have most experience with JavaScript, Go and lately Common Lisp.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-3">
        I had interest on programming since age 13. I was busy making <a href="https://github.com/trinityxtreme">game mods</a>{" "} 
        for my favorite video games. My highschool was focused on
        web-development, where I learned basic C programming and web
        development. For university, I first attended and completed education in
        Ankara University. I studied Japanese Language and Literature, which was
        totally a blast for my hungry mind. While I was attending that, I also
        studied Health Information Systems in Başkent University, where I
        learned more about programming, Go language (thanks to my final project)
        and Android app development. I finished this vocational training as
        first of my class. Right now I&apos;m studying International Relations
        in Anadolu University remotely.

        Turkish-Japanese Dictionary. I was planning to make a digital, easily
        usable dictionary for Japanese since my first year in university. There
        were many dictionary websites and apps for English-Japanese but none for
        my mother languge. Also my professors always pointed to shortcomings and
        inaccurate information on these dictionaries so as someone with
        necessary skills and knowledge I thought that I could do something
        better.

        Online Medicine Tracking System. This is actually remake of my final
        project in Başkent University. Me and a classmate of mine tried to make
        a web-based application where people would sign-up and add all the
        medicines they take regularly and give them alerts for expired drugs and
        when to take them. This, in turn, would create a massive online medicine
        catalog where everyone could use. For the first version (which we
        delivered to our teacher) we used Go and SQLite. User interface was
        simple server-side HTML5 + CSS. We used Bootstrap 5 and{" "}
        <a href="https://undraw.co/">unDraw</a> illustrations to make it look
        good.
